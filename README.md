# HoverHands
HoverHands is a Python-based gesture control system that uses MediaPipe, OpenCV, and PyAutoGUI to turn any webcam into a virtual mouse for hands-free computer interaction. 
It supports smooth cursor movement, left and right clicks, drag-and-drop, and scrolling â€” enabling a touchless, intuitive way to control the computer.
